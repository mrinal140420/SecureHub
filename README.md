**SecureHub** is a centralized platform developed as part of the **Semester VI Mini Project at Adamas University**.
It serves as a structured showcase for cybersecurity and machine learning projects created by the team, providing descriptions, demonstrations, and external links to individual tools and repositories.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

SecureHub is not a single tool, but a **unified platform** that brings together multiple cybersecurity and machine learning projects under one interface.
The platform is designed to present:

* Practical implementations of cybersecurity concepts
* Machine learning–based security solutions
* Real-world use cases and demonstrations
* External project links and live demos

The goal is to bridge **academic learning and real-world application** through a clean, accessible, and professional showcase.

## 🎯 Objectives

* To design a centralized platform for showcasing security-focused projects
* To demonstrate practical applications of cybersecurity and ML concepts
* To provide easy access to live demos and GitHub repositories
* To present projects in a structured and academic-friendly manner
